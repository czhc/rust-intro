# Rust Intro

Playground, study notes for Rust

_Programmers who need to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain._

## Notes

* use `cargo check` to check for safe compiles, does not produce executable. 
* `cargo build --release` -> `target/release`: optimized binary.
* adding dependencies/crates: edit `Cargo.toml` manually. crates are fetched from crates.io
